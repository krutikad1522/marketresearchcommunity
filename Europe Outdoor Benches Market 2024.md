<strong>Market Segment Analysis:</strong>

<strong><strong>By Price</strong></h4>
The price segment is divided into low (below USD 100), medium (USD 200 - 750), and high (more than USD 750). The medium price segment is projected to contribute the largest revenue share of over USD 1,539.56 million in the year 2028 during the forecast period. Outdoor benches of medium prices between USD 200 - 750 are commonly made of wood, aluminium, or stainless steel as their primary raw materials. Although aluminium is a readily abundant material, it is comparatively more expensive than iron, owing to the large amounts of electrical energy utilized during its extraction process. Thus, outdoor benches made of aluminium are relatively more expensive than metals including aluminium and steel. Further, stainless steel is also relatively more expensive to produce, owing to the addition of various alloying elements including iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, and copper to enhance its durability and corrosion resistance. Hence, outdoor benches composed of stainless steel are available at medium prices between USD 200 - 750.


<strong><strong>By Application</strong></h4>
The application segment is divided into residential and commercial.

The commercial segment is accounted to have largest share of 68.63% in the year 2021 owing to rise in numbers of commercial places such as buildings, hotels and restaurants, bars, and among others. According to the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council, the total investment in the commercial construction sector in Thailand increased by 8% in 2021 in order to meet the growing demand for a modern urban lifestyle in the country. The rapid pace of urbanization and the growth of the commercial sector are the prime factors driving the usage of outdoor benches. Thus, an increase in development of commercial buildings such as restaurants, hotels, resorts, bars, and other similar spaces will further boost the growth of the market in the upcoming years.
