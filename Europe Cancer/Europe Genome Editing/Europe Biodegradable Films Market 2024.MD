<strong>Market segmentation by manufacturers -</strong>


<strong><strong>By Type</strong></h4>
The type segment is separated into starch blends, biodegradable polyester (polycaprolactone (PCL), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and others), soy-based, cellulose-based, lignin-based and others. The starch blend segment is estimated to contribute the largest revenue share to the industry growth. The starch blend is extensively used in the reduction of the carbon footprint of traditional resins thus, propelling the market growth. Along with that starch blend is a bio-based and biodegradable film that has low toxicity.

Biodegradable polyester is projected to register the fastest CAGR growth during the forecast period due to the polylactic acid (PLA) sub-segment owing to the increased demand for its application in home products, textiles, electronic appliances, hygiene products, and agriculture. Moreover, PLA is a compostable and biodegradable thermoplastic manufactured via fermentation of sugar obtained from various renewable sources, such as sugarcane, wheat, corn starch, and tapioca roots.
<strong><strong>By Product Type</strong></h4>
The product type segment is classified into oxo-biodegradable, hydro-biodegradable, and photo-biodegradable. The oxo-biodegradable segment is projected to contribute the largest shares in the market growth during the forecast future. These plastic films are degraded by certain cell-mediated reactions and oxidative techniques by bacteria and fungi. Oxo-biodegradable films have been certified as safe for use with all food types at high temperatures due to which they are expected to grow in the market.

Furthermore, hydro-biodegradable plastics films are also expected to show a substantial share in the market growth owing to the factor that they degrade faster than any other bio-plastics. Since they are made using renewable resources they degrade faster. However, they are far more expensive and have less strength limiting their wide adoption in the market.
<strong><strong>By Application</strong></h4>
The application segment is divided into bags, mulch films, wrapping films, liners, food packaging, and others. The food packaging segment contributes the largest revenue share of 48% (1.15 million tons) in the overall biodegradable films market in 2021. Sectors such food industry, e-commerce, personal care &amp; cosmetics, and many more are finding a wide variety of applications in the packaging sector. Moreover, the shifting preferences of customers towards eco-friendly products are also encouraging manufacturers to lean towards bioplastics-based packaging.

Furthermore, mulch films are also projected to offer substantial growth over the forecasted future. The agriculture industry is the major key driver for this segment as they are widely used in specialty crop production due to their agronomic benefits. Moreover, they are a suitable alternative to traditional polyethylene.
<strong><strong>By End-Use</strong></h4>
The end-user segment is categorized into food &amp; beverage, agriculture &amp; horticulture, cosmetic &amp; personal care packaging, industrial packaging, and others. The food &amp; beverage sector is projected to hold the dominant share in terms of market revenue &amp; volume. This is attributed to the inclination of customers towards bio-based plastic films from conventional plastics as a result of increasing awareness about the environment. Different products such as egg trays, edible coatings, coating for beverage cups, and many more are finding a wide variety of applications in biodegradable films.

The agriculture &amp; horticulture segment is also estimated to augment the market over the forecasting future. The factors that mulch films are in high demand for plant cropping &amp;growth.

The profiled players are increasing adopting growth strategies, such as partnership, collaboration, merger and acquisition, awareness programs, takeovers, and more for creating strong market presence and an image in the minds of end users. The report also comprises the list of industry players for the end users. This also smoothens the communication between manufacturers and consumers.
