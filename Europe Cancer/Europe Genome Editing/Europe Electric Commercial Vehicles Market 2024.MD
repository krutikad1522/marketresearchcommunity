<strong>Market segmentation by manufacturers -</strong>

<strong><strong>By Propulsion</strong></h4>
The propulsion segment is divided into battery electric vehicles (BEV), Plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV), and Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV). The battery electric vehicles (BEV) segment is expected to witness the highest CAGR in the forecast period. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) is a battery-powered electric vehicle that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs. The Plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV) segment is also expected to account for a larger revenue due to its enhanced electricity storage capacity. Plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV) vehicles can be operated on electricity or fuel. Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) employ â€˜fuel cell technologyâ€™ to generate electricity. The chemical energy of the fuel is converted directly into electric energy to run the vehicle. This type of propulsion is adopted among a wide range of vehicles as it helps in reducing range anxiety among EV consumers.
<strong><strong>By Vehicle type</strong></h4>
Based on the vehicle type, the market is segmented into electric buses, electric trucks, electric vans, and electric pick-up trucks. The electric van segment is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period. Electric vans produce no carbon emissions leading to improved air quality and a better atmosphere. Electric buses, on the other hand, use electric motors and can store electricity in the battery packs. Electric pick-up trucks are also used in various end industries for picking up and transporting cargo from one destination to another.
<strong><strong>By Battery Capacity</strong></h4>
Based on the battery capacity, the market is segmented into less than 50 kWh, 50-250 kWh, and above 250 kWh. The less than 50 kWh batteries take around one hour to be charged around 80% of the battery capacity. Each kW adds up to 4 miles of range per hour. The 50-250kWh battery capacity will take up to 3 hours to charge its full capacity. The above 250kWh gives the best battery performance and is expected to give the highest CAGR in the forecast period. This capacity of battery witnesses favorable demand among original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), especially for electric commercial vehicles for fulfilling the need of long-haul transportation.
<strong><strong>By End-User</strong></h4>
Based on the end-user, the market is segmented into last-mile delivery, distribution, field services, long-haul transportation, and refuse collection services. The last-mile delivery is expected to expand at a significant CAGR during the forecast period. Electric vehicles are used majorly in last-mile delivery which means the final step of delivering the parcel from the hub to its destination location. They are also used in the distribution of raw materials to various end-use industries for manufacturing purposes. Electric vehicles are also being used for various field services wherein any product or some work has to be done at the customerâ€™s location. Another important application of electric vehicles is long-haul transportation which involves the movement of goods over distances above 400km. This is done usually with the help of electric trucks. Furthermore, electric trucks and cars are also used for refuse collection services engaged in collecting and transporting solid waste for disposal purposes.

The profiled players are increasing adopting growth strategies, such as partnership, collaboration, merger and acquisition, awareness programs, takeovers, and more for creating strong market presence and an image in the minds of end users. The report also comprises the list of industry players for the end users. This also smoothens the communication between manufacturers and consumers.
