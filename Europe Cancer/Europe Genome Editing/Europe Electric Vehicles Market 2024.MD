<strong>Market segmentation by manufacturers -</strong>

<strong><strong>By Propulsion</strong></h4>
The propulsion segment is divided into battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV), and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV). The BEV segment is expected to witness the fastest CAGR during the forecast period. A BEV is a battery-powered electric vehicle that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs. These types of electric vehicles witness favorable demand from consumers due to their easy maintenance and comparatively fast charging. Also, the PHEV segment is expected to account for a larger revenue contribution to the market growth due to its enhanced electricity storage capacity. PHEV vehicles can be operated on electricity or fuel. Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) employ â€˜fuel cell technologyâ€™ to generate electricity. FCEVs are powered with pure hydrogen gas which is stored in a fuel tank on the electric vehicle.
<strong><strong>By Vehicle Type</strong></h4>
Based on the vehicle type, the market is segmented into two-wheelers, passenger, and commercial vehicles. The passenger segment dominated the global market accounting for the highest revenue share. This is because of the presence of manufacturers as well as the increasing adoption of electric vehicles in several regions. Also, a large number of electric vehicles are available in the category of passenger segment due to the growing production by OEMs. Moreover, the commercial vehicle segment is also expected to witness an increase owing to rising innovations in the battery and load capacity of commercial vehicles. These commercial vehicles are primarily powered by hydrogen fuel cells which support the long haul of commercial trucks.
<strong><strong>By Battery Capacity</strong></h4>
Based on the battery capacity, the market is segmented into less than 50 kWh, 50-250 kWh, and above 250 kWh. The less than 50 kWh batteries take around one hour to be charged around 80% of the battery capacity. Each kW adds over 4 miles of range per hour. The 50-250kWh battery capacity will take up to 3 hours to charge its full capacity. The above 250kWh battery capacity is expected to grow with the fastest CAGR during the forecast period. Electric vehicles with this battery capacity are expected to witness increased preference among the population due to the availability of a driving range of over 400 miles on a single charge. Such high-capacity batteries provide increased power to the drivetrain which results in improved performance along with acceleration. Thus, all the mentioned factors are anticipated to support the market growth based on electric vehicle specifications and maintenance.
<strong><strong>By Range</strong></h4>
Based on range, the market is segmented into less than 150 miles, 150 to 300 miles, and above 300 miles. Majorly, passenger electric vehicles have a range of fewer than 150 miles. The manufacturing costs of electric vehicles that fall within this range are comparatively lower than commercial electric vehicles. Additionally, such electric vehicles act as convenient commute alternatives to daily business chores, which results in favorable preference among large numbers of the population. Moreover, commercial vehicles have a range of above 300 miles as they are used for long and time-consuming distances. Such large-range vehicles are offered at comparatively high costs as they have a better battery capacity as per their range.
<strong><strong>By End-Use</strong></h4>
Based on the end-user, the market is bifurcated into private and commercial fleets. Passenger electric vehicles are increasingly being adopted by a large section of the population, leading to the growth of the private segment. For instance, public transport vehicles have shifted from fuel-driven vehicles to electric vehicles. Also, the growing disposable income and environmental awareness among the population have resulted in the adoption of various priced electric vehicles. Further, electric vehicles are also used for commercial purposes in several industries such as logistics, agriculture, and transportation. Electric commercial vehicles can range from vans, buses, trucks, and agricultural vehicles, such as tractors or combine harvesters to construction machineries such as wheel loaders or excavators. Thus, the adoption of such electric commercial vehicles is expected to result in a reduced carbon footprint caused due to such heavy-load vehicles.

The profiled players are increasing adopting growth strategies, such as partnership, collaboration, merger and acquisition, awareness programs, takeovers, and more for creating strong market presence and an image in the minds of end users. The report also comprises the list of industry players for the end users. This also smoothens the communication between manufacturers and consumers.
