<strong>Market Segment Analysis:</strong>


<strong><strong>By Nature</strong></h4>
Based on the nature, the market is bifurcated into organic and conventional segments. The conventional segment accounts for the highest revenue share in the forecast period. These are the products that are made using pesticides and chemical herbicides. Farmers also use antibiotics and growth hormones for the production of conventional immunity-boosting products. Due to this reason, the prices for conventional food products are quite low accounting for its high market share. Organic immunity-boosting food products, on the other hand, are grown without the use of fertilizers, growth regulators, and additives. Therefore, the prices of such products are high in comparison to conventional food products.
<strong><strong>By Product</strong></h4>
Based on the product, the market is segmented into nuts &amp; seeds, fruits &amp; vegetables, probiotics &amp; prebiotics, herbs &amp; spices dairy-based products, and others. Fruits and vegetables are emerging as the most common immunity-boosting food products. Their easy accessibility and high nutritious value account for the growth of this segment. Probiotics and prebiotics make use of beneficial microorganisms to provide nutritional aspects to the body. Prebiotics are present in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains whereas probiotics are present in fermented foods such as yogurt. Dairy-based products are derived from animals such as cows and buffalo and have high nutritious value. Nuts &amp; seeds including almonds and walnuts are a good source of proteins, fibers, vitamins, and minerals. Herbs and spices are good sources of antioxidants and play an important role in avoiding various diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and others.
<strong><strong>By Distribution Channel</strong></h4>
The distribution channel segment is divided into online and offline. Immunity-boosting food products are sold through E-commerce and company-owned websites. Whereas they are also available offline in retail chains such as supermarkets &amp; hypermarkets, convenience stores, and specialty stores. The factors such as the availability of a wide range of products, in-store discounts for new product launches, and bulk purchasing options at the same location are estimated to support the growth of the supermarket stores segment. Also, online stores are expected to register substantial growth during the forecast period owing to the consumer shift to reduced visits to physical stores for product purchases. This is mainly due to the busy lifestyle of the working population and increased benefits to the sellers in terms of upfront cost reduction such as store repairs, rents, shop design, and inventory. Further, the customer benefits such as quick price comparison, fast product delivery, and the comfort of shopping from home are a few benefits that favor the preference for online channels among the majority of the population.
<strong><strong>By End-User</strong></h4>
Based on the end-user, the market is segmented into infants &amp; children, and adults. The adult segment is anticipated to account for the largest immunity boosting food products market share in the forecast period. This is mainly due to the increase in the number of chronic diseases among the elderly population, making them consume more immune-boosting foods. Additionally, the growing awareness among the aged population in terms of preventive antibiotics or food products also results in high demand for such immunity-boosting products. Further, infants and children also consume immunity-boosting foods as prescribed by their general physician. It is difficult to make young kids or infants eat natural immunity-boosting food such as broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, and others. Thus, several pediatricians prescribe certain supplements rich in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc, which play a major role in supporting healthy growth among kids.
