<strong>Market segmentation by manufacturers -</strong>


<strong><strong>By Product</strong></h4>
The product segment is divided into specialty kraft paper and sack kraft paper. The sack kraft paper segment dominates the kraft paper market with the fastest CAGR of over 4.04% in the forecasted future. With the increasing expansion of the building and construction sector, the demand for sack kraft paper is expected to witness an increase attributed to high mechanical strength. In addition, these papers find wide applications such as coating, packaging &amp; wrapping, laminating, and spiral-wound products as sack paper contain up to 5% recycled materials. Further, the food industry also takes advantage of sack kraft papers owing to the factor that it meets all the food contact requirements for greasy, wet, and dry food below 220Â°C, if it is produced naturally.
<strong><strong>By Type</strong></h4>
The type segment is bifurcated into virgin kraft paper and natural kraft paper. Virgin kraft paper is the largest contributor in the world of papers due to which these papers are estimated to dominate the market in the forecasting period. Owing to its strong, durable, and clean fiber content, they find many heavy-duty applications in several different sectors. Additionally, they are suitable for printing which makes them suitable for industrial branded packaging, pallet interleaving, protective layering, and wrapping.

However, natural kraft papers are not as strong and tear-resistant as virgin kraft paper but still have the strength to perform jobs like void filling and liners for boxes and trays. Moreover, they are recyclable which makes them biocompatible and cost-effective. Due to this factor, they are gaining popularity among the food &amp; beverages, packaging, and e-commerce industries.
<strong><strong>By Grade Type</strong></h4>
The grade type segment is divided into bleached and unbleached. The bleached segment also known as white kraft papers is estimated to dominate the market and is projected to increase the market growth in the coming future. These papers undergo several chemical and bleaching treatments that make stronger and more durable kraft papers than the known conventional ones. Due to their high mechanical strength, they are used in packaging &amp; wrapping, and protective layering sectors. These papers are 100% recyclable and eco-friendly which promotes their usage in varied sectors for several applications. Further, unbleached softwood kraft pulp is also used in electrical transformer boards, cement, fiber, and packaging along with insulation papers and specialty papers. Thus, it is typically noticed by major end-use customers to differentiate between bleached and unbleached kraft paper as unbleached ones are offered only in brown color. Being completely free of chlorine, this paper is widely used as the perfect option for disposable packaging purposes by end-use industries, especially hotels and restaurants.
<strong><strong>By Finished Type </strong></h4>
Based on finished the market is segmented into glazed and finished. The finished segment is further sub-segmented into machine finished and smooth-finished. This segment is anticipated to hold dominance in the market growth in terms of the largest market share. The factors such as superior print quality, smooth texture, and convertibility are considered during using these papers in carrier bags, wrappings, PE laminated products, fill and seal applications, and aluminum foil applications. Further, the glazed component is also projected to support the market growth in terms of value. Glazed paper is bleached kraft paper that has a high glossy texture on one side of the paper making them opaque, durable, and printable. Thus, these papers are predominantly used in industrial coating &amp; lamination and food packaging &amp; wrapping applications for increased aesthetics of the end product.
<strong><strong>By Packaging Form</strong></h4>
Based on packaging form, the market is divided into bags and pouches, sacks, envelopes, corrugated sheets, cartons, and others. Among these packaging forms, corrugated sheets hold the market dominance of over 36.5% share. These sheets are widely used in the shipment and transportation industry owing to the factors that they protect the goods and offer easy handling of shipment. Moreover, they are recyclable and reusable, hence minimizing waste. Different sectors such as construction &amp; building, food &amp; beverages, personal care &amp; cosmetics have a high demand for corrugated sheets. Moreover, the bags and pouches segment is also anticipated to contribute substantial shares in terms of volume. This packaging form witnesses high demand especially in food delivery services. Such favorable preference is due to the heat-sealed closure type and matte finish of the pouch.
<strong><strong>By End Use </strong></h4>
The end user segment is separated into food and beverages, pharmaceutical, building and construction, cosmetic and personal care, electronics and electrical, and others. The food &amp; beverages (F&amp;B) industry contributes the largest market share in terms of volume and revenues. This industry is responsible for maintaining high product quality in terms of biodegradable grade, ease of transportation over long distances, and high weight capacity. Furthermore, the construction &amp; building segment is also projected to support the market growth in terms of revenue. Heavy duty application required in this segment is filled by the kraft papers owing to their high tensile strength, strong durability, and flexibility. These properties are of high use in the manufacturing of building products such as protective sheets over the flooring, cabinets, and countertops which reduces the fear of foot traffic, paint, spills, or any type of staining.

The profiled players are increasing adopting growth strategies, such as partnership, collaboration, merger and acquisition, awareness programs, takeovers, and more for creating strong market presence and an image in the minds of end users. The report also comprises the list of industry players for the end users. This also smoothens the communication between manufacturers and consumers.
