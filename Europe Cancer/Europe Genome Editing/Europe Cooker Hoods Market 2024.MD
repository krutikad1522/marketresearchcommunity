<strong>Market Segment Analysis:</strong>


<strong><strong>By Product Type</strong></h4>
The product type segment is categorized into wall-mounted, telescopic, ceiling-mounted, under-cabinet, canopy, and others. The under-cabinets segment is anticipated to contribute substantial shares to the market growth in terms of revenue. These cabinets are small and compact that are generally preferred by consumers as they easily blend with any kitchen aesthetic. Due to their small size, they are a great fit for smaller kitchens, as they are only 52-60 cm in size. Furthermore, wall-mounted hoods are also projected to contribute substantial shares to the cooker hoods market. These hoods are directly installed on the wall of the kitchen, above the stove. Due to their large size, the ventilation provided by them is high quality as they absorb all the fume and smoke. These hoods act as a favorable extraction system as they are directly attached to the existing duct of kitchen areas.
<strong><strong>By Size</strong></h4>
The size segment is trifurcated into less than 80cm, 80-105cm, and more than 105 cm. The 80-105cm segment in cooker hoods is expected to contribute the largest shares in terms of volume. These cooker hoods serve as the perfect fit for the average-sized kitchen with a small working area. These average-sized hoods are mainly used with induction hobs, where steam and fumes spread out further. This is because the length of the worktop to the hood surface requires an equivalently wide cooker hood for effective suction of fumes and odors. Thus, the 80-105 cm segment is anticipated to boost the market growth in the forecast period. Moreover, sectors such as hotels and restaurants are also set to boost the more than 105 cm segment during the forecast period. These sectors require proper ventilation and filtration due to their large kitchen spaces. Thus, the presence of a large network of hotels and restaurants is anticipated to increase the demand for more than 105 cm cooker hoods as these businesses heavily depend on kitchen activities.
<strong><strong>By Extraction Type</strong></h4>
The extraction type segment is divided into extractor hoods and recirculation hoods. The extractor hoods segment is estimated to register the fastest CAGR growth during the forecast period. These systems are mainly adopted due to their effective extraction rate. These extractors are available at varied power settings and generate low noise levels. Thus, consumers highly integrate these extractor hoods in their kitchen spaces as a part of open-plan living spaces. Furthermore, the recirculation hood is also projected to contribute substantially in terms of revenue for market growth. As the name suggests, instead of extracting, these systems recycle the same air via grease or charcoal filters and vent it back to the kitchen. These hoods gain favorable demand among consumers with newly built house structures. These types of hoods do not require a large hole in the outer walls of the house, which helps in stabilizing the energy label of the house.
<strong><strong>By Suction Power</strong></h4>
The suction power is segmented into less than 800 m3/h, 800-1200 m3/h, and more than 1200 m3/h. The 800-1200m3/h segment is estimated to share the largest CAGR growth during the forecast future. This segment witnessed a major increase due to the high requirement of this range in decorative cooker hoods. Thus, the increased rate of decorative hood adoption has resulted in segment growth. Further, such suction power aspect is mainly taken into consideration by consumers while making the buying decisions of such hoods. Thus, factors such as duct size, food preparation style, number of angles given to the ducting, and design &amp; duct style mainly affect the suction power of any cooking hood. Thus, the majority of consumers prefer hoods with more suction power for increasing the performance of such hoods. Further, in the context of cooker hood design, straight line chimney style requires 700 m3/hr suction power for effective functioning. However, the suction power of decorative oneâ€™s this suction power range from 800 m3/hr to 1200 m3/hr.
<strong><strong>By Distribution Channel</strong></h4>
The distribution channel is segmented into online and offline. The online channels are mainly preferred by the mass consumer base which is attributed to the largest share contribution of this segment to the market growth. In the online distribution channel, cooker hoods can be purchased through e-commerce websites and online marketplaces. These platforms offer a wide range of options for customers, including various brands, models, and price points.

Online retailers also offer the convenience of home delivery and easy returns.

Furthermore, the offline segment is also projected to boost the demand for cooker goods in the cooker hoods market statistics during the forecast period. This is attributed to the fact that cooker hoods can be purchased through traditional brick-and-mortar stores such as home appliance stores, department stores, and specialty stores. These stores typically offer a wide range of options for customers, including various brands, models, and price points. The main advantage of offline distribution channels is that customers can see, touch, and test the products before making a purchase. This is particularly important for high-end products where customers want to ensure quality and compatibility before making a purchase.
<strong><strong>By End User</strong></h4>
The end-user segment is separated into residential, and commercial. The residential end-users are expected to support the market growth in terms of the largest revenue shares. The market is driven by the increasing demand for home appliances and the growing construction industry. The residential segment includes single-family homes, apartments, and condominiums. In addition, the increasing number of new housing units and renovation projects. The growing popularity of open-plan kitchens and the increasing emphasis on kitchen design is also driving the demand for cooker hoods in the residential sector.

Furthermore, the commercial segment is also estimated to project substantial growth in the market. This is attributed to the fact that the increasing demand for energy-efficient appliances in commercial kitchens.
